# ATM_Project
We are tasked with creating a general database for an ATM Management System. These ATMs are ran 
by the same company so transaction numbers are shared
, mechanically set per ATM, but are assigned 
to several different b
anks and accounts. System should allow for tracking money in member accounts, 
the ATMs, and the banks attached to each other. System should allow for 
updating
a new member and 
account based on provided JSON files. They should also run simple statistical an
d analytic methods using 
aggregated functions and programming code.
